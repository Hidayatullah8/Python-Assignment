    "\"\"\" Q1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language? \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "object-oriented programming (OOP): \n",
    "\n",
    "    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects,\n",
    "rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Examples\n",
    "of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and address,\n",
    "down to small computer programs, such as widgets. This opposes the historical approach to programming where emphasis was \n",
    "placed on how the logic was written rather than how to define the data within the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in OOP is to identify all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other, \n",
    "an exercise often known as data modeling. Once an object is known, it is generalized as a class of objects that defines the \n",
    "kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method \n",
    "and objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.\n",
    "Simply put, OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.\n",
    "This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Due to \n",
    "the organization of an object-oriented program, this method is also conducive to collaborative development where projects can\n",
    "be divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability  and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principles of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is based on the following principles:\n",
    "Encapsulation- The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary,or class. Other objects\n",
    "do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or \n",
    "methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.\n",
    "Abstraction- Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary \n",
    "implementation code. This concept helps developers make changes and additions over time more easily.\n",
    "Inheritance- Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while\n",
    "still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and\n",
    "ensures a higher level of accuracy.\n",
    "Polymorphism- Objects are allowed to take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which\n",
    "meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down on the need to duplicate code."

    "\"\"\" Q2: List down the Benefits of OOP?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Something has gone wrong, and you have no idea where to look. Is the problem in the Widget file, or is it the WhaleFlumper? \n",
    "Will you have to trudge through that “sewage.c” file? Hope you commented your code!\n",
    "When working with object-oriented programming languages, you know exactly where to look. “Oh, the car object broke down? The\n",
    "problem must be in the Car class!” You don’t have to muck through anything else.\n",
    "That’s the beauty of encapsulation. Objects are self-contained, and each bit of functionality does its own thing while leaving\n",
    "the other bits alone. Also, this modality allows an IT team to work on multiple objects simultaneously while minimizing the \n",
    "chance that one person might duplicate someone else’s functionality.\n",
    "We can help you find your next programming job:\n",
    "SEARCH JOBS\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reuse of code through inheritance:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Suppose that in addition to your Car object, one colleague needs a RaceCar object, and another needs a Limousine object.\n",
    "Everyone builds their objects separately but discover commonalities between them. In fact, each object is really just a \n",
    "different kind of Car. This is where the inheritance technique saves time: Create one generic class (Car), and then define\n",
    "the subclasses (RaceCar and Limousine) that are to inherit the generic class’s traits.\n",
    "Of course, Limousine and RaceCar still have their unique attributes and functions. If the RaceCar object needs a method to\n",
    "“fireAfterBurners” and the Limousine object requires a Chauffeur, each class could implement separate functions just for itself. However, because both classes inherit key aspects from the Car class, for example the “drive” or “fillUpGas” methods, your inheriting classes can simply reuse existing code instead of writing these functions all over again.\n",
    "What if you want to make a change to all Car objects, regardless of type? This is another advantage of the OO approach. Simply\n",
    "make a change to your Car class, and all car objects will simply inherit the new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility through polymorphism:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Riffing on this example, you now need just a few drivers, or functions, like “driveCar,” driveRaceCar” and “DriveLimousine.” \n",
    "RaceCarDrivers share some traits with LimousineDrivers, but other things, like RaceHelmets and BeverageSponsorships, are unique.\n",
    "This is where object-oriented programming’s sweet polymorphism comes into play. Because a single function can shape-shift to\n",
    "adapt to whichever class it’s in, you could create one function in the parent Car class called “drive” — not “driveCar” or \n",
    "“driveRaceCar,” but just “drive.” This one function would work with the RaceCarDriver, LimousineDriver, etc. In fact, you could\n",
    "even have “raceCar.drive(myRaceCarDriver)” or “limo.drive(myChauffeur).”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Effective problem solving:\n",
    "    \n",
    "A language like C has an amazing legacy in programming history, but writing software in a top-down language is like playing \n",
    "Jenga while wearing mittens. The more complex it gets, the greater the chance it will collapse. Meanwhile, writing a functional-\n",
    "style program in a language like Haskell or ML can be a chore.\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is often the most natural and pragmatic approach, once you get the hang of it. OOP languages allows\n",
    "you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve — one object at a time.\n",
    "This isn’t to say that OOP is the One True Way. However, the advantages of object-oriented programming are many. When you need\n",
    "to solve complex programming challenges and want to add code tools to your skill set, OOP is your friend — and has much greater\n",
    "longevity and utility than Pac-Man or parachute pants.\n",

    "\"\"\" Q3: Differentiate between function and method?\"\"\"\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object (dependent).A method is implicitly passed the object on which \n",
    "it is invoked. It may or may not return any data. A method can operate on the data (instance variables) that is contained by \n",

    "‘Class and its Object‘. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2). Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can’t be called by its name only, we\n",

    "Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.\n",
    "The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming. Among the important ideas about classes are:\n",
    "A class can have subclasses that can inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class. In relation to each subclass, the\n",
    "class becomes the superclass.\n",
    "Subclasses can also define their own methods and variables that are not part of their superclass.\n",

    "of object and even more generic classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in \n",

    "(3) Attribute:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        In general, an attribute is a characteristic. In a database management system (DBMS), an attribute refers to a database \n",
    "component, such as a table. It also may refer to a database field. Attributes describe the instances in the row of a database.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "(4) Behavior:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Behavior testing simply means that we should test how an application behaves in certain situations. Often the behavior is given\n",
    "to us developers by our customers. They describe the functionality of an application, and we write code to meet their \n",
    "specifications. Behavioral tests are a tool to formalize their requirements into tests. This leads naturally to behavior-driven\n",
